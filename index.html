      summary: "A crisp winter overnighter with the hot tent, biscuits and gravy, and good company on one of Washington's best ridgelines.",
      content: `
        <p>There is nothing quite like the contrast of a freezing cold ridge and a wood-burning stove glowing inside a tent. For this trip, we headed to <strong>Silver Star Mountain</strong> in Washington. At 3,490 feet, it’s not the tallest peak, but it offers some of the most expansive views in the area.</p>

        <h3>The Crew & The Climb</h3>
        <p>I headed out with the usual suspects: my girlfriend Kelsey, our friend Luke, and his wife Helen. We started at the Silver Star Trailhead on a crisp, partly cloudy day. The air had that sharp winter bite that lets you know you're in the mountains.</p>

        <img src="images/image4.jpg" alt="Hiking up Silver Star" style="width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 12px;">
        <p class="image-caption">Hiking up toward the ridge.</p>

        <p>The hike in is about two miles to where we planned to camp. We wanted privacy, so we pushed off-trail to find a spot away from any other hikers. We found a perfect patch of snow to pitch the tent, ensuring we had a flat base for the night.</p>

        <h3>The Hot Tent Setup</h3>
        <p>The star of the show (besides the mountain) was the gear. I brought my <strong>Lite Outdoors Plateau 5 Ultralight</strong> tent paired with their large titanium stove. It's technically a 5-person tent, which meant plenty of room for the four of us and gear.</p>
        
        <p>Once base camp was set, we dropped our heavy packs and hiked the rest of the way to the summit. The views were incredible—we could see for miles.</p>

        <p class="image-caption">The crew at the top: Helen, Luke, Kelsey, and me.</p>

        <h3>Burgers & Biscuits</h3>
        <p>We hiked back down to camp as the sun began to dip. This is when the hot tent changes the game. Instead of shivering in sleeping bags, we fired up the titanium stove. We cooked burgers right there on the stove for dinner, staying warm while the temperature outside plummeted.</p>

        <p>The next morning, we kept the luxury going with biscuits and gravy before packing up. It was a short trip—just one night—but exactly what we needed.</p>

      summary: "12 days from Oregon to the Grand Canyon and back. Two nights backpacking Sheiks Canyon, sleeping in a Tesla, and proving you don't need campgrounds to see the West.",
      content: `
        <p>There is a specific kind of freedom that comes from leaving your driveway in Banks, Oregon, knowing you have no reservations. No hotels booked, no campsites reserved. Just us, the Tesla, and 3,000 miles of open road ahead. The plan was simple: head south until the dirt turned red, stay out as long as we could, and never pay to sleep.</p>
        
        <p>The first leg was a blur of asphalt. We pushed hard through the desolate stretches of Idaho and the busy corridor of Salt Lake City. The goal was to reach the Utah border before stopping. We weren't interested in cities; we were chasing that specific silence you only find in the high desert.</p>

        <h3>The Setup: The "Tesla Hotel"</h3>
        <p>The most common question we get is, "How do you camp in an EV?" The answer is: surprisingly luxuriously. People think EV road trips are restrictive, bound by charging stations and range anxiety. But once you leave the interstate, the car becomes a self-contained pod.</p>

        <p>We turned the back of the Model Y into a permanent bedroom. We folded the seats down and installed a fitted air mattress that stayed inflated for the entire 12 days. The real game-changer, however, is "Camp Mode." It maintains climate control, airflow, and white noise all night with minimal battery drain. We slept comfortably in freezing high-desert nights and 90-degree heat without ever idling an engine.</p>
        
        <img src="images/image_1.png" alt="Morning coffee while dispersed camping next to the Tesla" style="width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 12px;">
        <p class="image-caption">Morning routine: Coffee on BLM land, zero fees.</p>

        <p>The rule of the trip was strict: <strong>Dispersed camping only.</strong> We relied entirely on public lands—finding hidden pull-offs down long dirt roads far from the RV parks and generator noise. There is something magical about waking up, opening the trunk, and seeing nothing but sagebrush and sandstone for miles.</p>

        <h3>Part 1: The Red Rock Initiation</h3>
        <p>We hit the "Mighty 5" area with force. Canyonlands and Arches are spectacular, but they are also crowded. We spent our days navigating the paved viewpoints with the masses. Canyonlands makes you feel incredibly small; the sheer scale of the drop-offs is hard to comprehend until you are standing right on the edge.</p>

        <img src="images/image_4.png" alt="Standing on the edge of a cliff in Canyonlands" style="width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 12px;">
        
        <p>We found ways to make it our own, scrambling on the slickrock near Moab and finding quiet corners to mess around. Even in the most popular parks, if you walk a mile away from the parking lot, the crowds disappear.</p>

        <img src="images/image_3.png" alt="Handstands under an arch formation" style="width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 12px;">

        <p>But the crowds in the National Parks were eventually wearing on us. We didn't come all this way to stand in line for a photo. We needed silence. We needed to get away from the pavement.</p>

        <h3>Part 2: The Deep Backcountry</h3>
        <p>We drove south towards Bears Ears National Monument. The goal was the <strong>Sheiks Canyon to Bullet Canyon loop</strong> on Cedar Mesa. This isn't a park trail; it's a route. We parked the Tesla at the trailhead, loaded two days of water into our packs, and dropped over the rim.</p>
        
        <p>Down there, the world changes. It’s raw canyon hiking—scrambling over dry pour-offs, navigating confusing slickrock benches, and bushwhacking through tamarisk. The silence is profound. It rings in your ears.</p>

        <img src="images/image_0.png" alt="Ancient Puebloan ruins in a large alcove in Sheiks Canyon" style="width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 12px;">
        <p class="image-caption">Discovering well-preserved ruins in the silence of Sheiks Canyon.</p>

        <p>The highlight was turning a corner into a massive alcove and finding perfectly preserved Ancestral Puebloan ruins. Standing there, miles from the nearest road, looking at structures built by hand a thousand years ago, was the spiritual center of the trip. We camped on hard sandstone nearby, watching the stars framed by canyon walls, imagining the people who called this place home centuries ago.</p>

        <h3>Part 3: Mars on Earth</h3>
        <p>After dragging our dusty, tired bodies out of Bullet Canyon, we needed a change of scenery. We drove past Hanksville to <strong>Factory Butte and the Bentonite Hills</strong>. It felt like leaving Earth entirely.</p> 
        
        <p>The landscape looks like Mars—dunes of grey, purple, and vibrant red clay stretching into the distance, dominated by the massive shark-fin-like butte. We set up camp right at the base. As the sun went down, the colors shifted from harsh greys to soft purples. It was one of the most surreal campsites of my life.</p>

        <img src="images/image_5.png" alt="The Tesla parked in the alien landscape of Factory Butte" style="width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 12px;">
        <p class="image-caption">Camped on Mars (Factory Butte, Utah).</p>

        <h3>Part 4: The Giants</h3>
        <p>The trip continued south. We hit Bryce Canyon, stood on the rim of the Grand Canyon, and spent time in Zion. Zion is breathtaking, but the crowds are intense. We escaped high up, finding views that put the scale of the place into perspective.</p>
        
        <p>It was a moment to just pause and appreciate having someone to share this with. 3,000 miles is a long way to drive, but it's easy when you have the right co-pilot.</p>

        <img src="images/image_2.png" alt="Hugging at a high viewpoint in Zion National Park" style="width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 12px;">

        <p>Finally, it was time to turn north. After ten days in the red desert, our eyes needed green. We swung wide into California to visit <strong>Sequoia National Park</strong>.</p>
        
        <p>Seeing trees wide enough to drive a car through was the perfect palette cleanser before the long haul back to the PNW. Pictures don't do them justice; you have to stand next to one to understand. They feel ancient, like silent watchers of the forest. It was the perfect end to a trip defined by big landscapes.</p>

        <h3>Trip Stats</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Total Distance:</strong> ~3,200 miles</li>
            <li><strong>Duration:</strong> 12 Days</li>
